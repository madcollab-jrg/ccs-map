The most obvious way that people are impacted is through displacement. When the city becomes too hot to live in, people move out of the city and into other areas, leaving their homes behind. This is especially true in cities that have been built up over time and don't offer much in terms of green spaces or places to cool down.

Another way that people are affected is through their access to air conditioning. In some areas, there is no air conditioning at all—and if there is, it's not affordable for everyone who needs it. Others may not have access to electricity at all. This means that they're stuck without any way to cool down when temperatures rise too high.","used public transportation, biking or walking instead of driving a car.; switched to renewable energy sources (e.g. solar panels or wind power) for my home.; installed energy-efficient lighting or appliances in my home or weatherized my home; installed green infrastructure like a rain garden or rain barrel at my home or neighborhood",Local government can help mitigate urban heat in my community by encouraging the use of green roofs and other sustainable practices.,"Local news outlets (TV, radio, newspapers); Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)",Yes,"In the face of climate change, it's important for local governments to take steps to reduce urban heat.

One day I noticed him continuing to work in the garden in the heat of midday. I was concerned that he might be affected by the heat wave, so I persuaded him to go inside and rest to avoid excessive exposure to the heat. However, he said he felt fine, just a little hot. When I got home a few hours later, I noticed that he wasn't moving around the yard as usual. I went to knock on the door, but I got no response. I was so worried that I immediately called the police and asked them to deal with the critical situation. Police and emergency services quickly arrived and entered his home. However, he had lost consciousness and was having difficulty breathing. Emergency personnel immediately began administering first aid, trying to restore his breathing and heartbeat, and rushed him to the hospital. Unfortunately, he eventually died of a heat attack.
